My name's Wyatt Lucas and I'm a software engineer. I graduated from Rutgers University in August 2020 with a BA in Information Technology and Minor in Creative Writing.
In my free time, I like [lifting weights](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68uieaN5RaMndJTyv07qbZ7oeJWZBjGV), cardio, [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12561046-wyatt), [listening to music](https://rateyourmusic.com/~yutsi), and [watching TV](https://trakt.tv/users/yutsi)/[anime](https://anilist.co/user/yutsi/animelist). I've been vegan since January 2018.
